# LANDING_PAGE
#ProdigyInfotech  Welcome to the Interactive Navigation Menu project! This project demonstrates how to create a modern, responsive navigation menu that changes its style dynamically based on user interaction. The menu is fixed at the top of the page, remains visible on all pages, and features smooth transitions for hover and scroll effects.
